    comment:"My experience in crystal pathsala is really very good because I learnt a lot from there like vocab as well as  grammar structure. Kajal mam is very humble nd teaches very gently...all things are great about this institute...mam helps students in all ways like she boosts the confidence of students nd motivate them .....they also teach students about body language nd make ready them for interviews...... They prefer more in speaking practicing  speaking than in writing that's why students learn more from there .... If u want to learn  English even from basic they will help u but u also have to give ur 100 %....it is really very good institute for English learning as well as personality development..."
